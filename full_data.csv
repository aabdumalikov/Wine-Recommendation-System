Amarone Costasera Masi hails from the vineyards overlooking picturesque Lake Garda, in the Valpolicella Classica area, one of the reference points for this type of wine, which, together with Barolo and Brunello, symbolizes the aristocracy of Italian red wines. Masi's Costasera is the result of the winery's long experience in drying techniques.
Masi's Amarone Classico Costasera is made from Corvina, Rondinella and Molinara grapes, all harvested and selected by hand. Once harvested, the grapes are placed on bamboo racks, which allow air to circulate between the grapes and limit the formation of mould. The grapes remain on the racks throughout the winter, concentrating sugars and aromas thanks to the slow drying process. Once the grapes have reached an ideal degree of dryness, they are pressed and undergo alcoholic fermentation. Most of the wine thus obtained is aged for 24 months in Slavonian oak barrels, the rest in barriques.
Costasera Masi Amarone has an intense ruby red colour. The nose opens with an intense bouquet of cooked fruit, plums and cherries. On the palate it is fruity, enriched with aromas of coffee and cocoa, which make it a refined, balanced and pleasantly elegant wine that goes well with roast, braised and stewed red meats and game, as well as seasoned cheeses.
Why is Amarone Costasera Masi called this way?
 Amarone Costasera bears this name because the Masi winery believes that the coasts facing the sunset, in Valpolicella Classica, are the best for the production of a great Amarone.
 These are the vineyards that enjoy longer hours of sunshine and benefit from the reflection of the light on Lake Garda. Thanks to these particularly favourable climatic conditions, the grapes here reach perfect ripeness.
Amarone Costasera is also available in the Riserva and Nectar versions, which contain a higher percentage of the Corvina grapes, giving this wine even more softness and roundness."

 Antinori is one of the most illustrious and famous names in the world of Italian wine. The company was born in Tuscany from a long family tradition, which can boast over six hundred years of history. In addition to the winery in the Chianti Classico area, it has estates in Bolgheri, Montalcino, Umbria and Franciacorta. The Guado al Tasso estate is located in the countryside near the historic village of Bolgheri, near the Tyrrhenian coast. It is a real farm of about 1000 hectares, of which 300 are vineyards and the rest cultivated with olive trees, arable land, woods or used for breeding pigs of the fine Cinta Senese variety.  The Bolgheri area has become world famous for the production of famous Supertuscan, wines made with international grapes, in particular cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc and syrah, which have found favorable conditions in this land to express themselves on levels of excellence . The suitable soils, the Mediterranean climate, warm, dry, but always mitigated by the sea breezes and the gentle hillside exposures, have proved to be perfect for quality viticulture. In the wake of the international success of Sassicaia, in the 70s and 80s, the myth of the great Bolgheri reds quickly spread. Wines of extraordinary elegance, richness and aromatic complexity, which soon collected the most prestigious prizes and awards from the main Italian Wine Guides and from the most famous international sector magazines.  Bolgheri DOC Il Bruciato comes from a blend of three great French vines, cabernet sauvignon (65%) which gives structure, elegance and longevity, merlot (20%) which gives softness and harmony and the syrah (15%) which gives the typical spicy notes, which enrich and complete the bouquet.  The grapes, carefully selected in the vineyard, ferment for about 10-15 days partly in barriques and partly in stainless steel tanks, at a temperature of 28-30 ° C. Only a part of merlot and syrah ferments at lower temperatures to better extract and preserve the fragrance of the varietal aromas. After a first period of stabilization, partly in steel and partly in barrique for malolactic fermentation, the wine ages for 8 months in French oak barrique and completes its aging with a further 4 months in the bottle.

Cantine Ceci's Otello Nero di Lambrusco is a wine that has changed the image of Lambrusco in the world. It has transformed a popular and everyday wine into an absolute excellence. Ceci's research into the highest quality Lambruscos has enabled the winery to move away from the common perception of Lambrusco as a simple, pleasant and sociable wine, and to raise it to the level of the best expressions of Italian oenology. Otello Nero di Lambrusco is a label that perfectly combines the identity of a wine linked to the history of a territory, with a vision aimed at creating a Lambrusco capable of satisfying the most expert and demanding consumers. The basis of the wine is the Lambrusco Maestri, one of the varieties of the great Lambrusco family, which has been present in Emilia since time immemorial. These are indigenous vines, the result of the ancient domestication of the Vitis vinifera silvestris, already known in Roman times under the name of Labrusca. It is a grape of great personality that still preserves some of its original characteristics, especially in the presence of a particularly lively and indomitable acidity.
The Lambrusco Otello Nero has managed to combine its characteristic fruitness and freshness with the structure, aromatic complexity and depth of flavour that make it a great wine. Its dynamic and highly drinkable sip makes it extremely modern, perfectly in line with the style that is emerging in the current panorama of red wines, based more on fluency and expressive immediacy and increasingly far from the desperate search for extraction and concentration.

After cold decanting for 24 hours, the alcoholic fermentation phase begins in French oak barrels, half new and half of the previous year, lasting 15–20 days. The malolactic fermentation continues inside the same barriques, until the ageing phase for 12 months in oak barriques, with bâtonnage technique, or with the movement of fine lees and yeasts deposited on the bottom.  Characterized by a bright golden yellow colour, Cabreo La Pietra by Folonari has a rich and intense olfactory bouquet. The spicy hints, which bring to mind the aroma of vanilla, are pleasantly combined with the notes of butter and peach compote. On the palate it is velvety, harmonious and complex, distinguishing itself as a lucky combination of the elegance and delicacy typical of white wines and the strength and character of the reds.  Ideal to be served with white meat dishes, it is excellent with fish and shellfish courses and with vegetable based first courses. "

 Dr. Loosen's Ürziger Würzgarten Riesling Auslese comes from a vineyard defined by red and sandy volcanic soils with a steep slope. Known for the spicy characteristics it can give to wines, this vineyard is called the ""spice garden"" and is located in the Moselle area.  The harvest takes place when the overripe grapes have reached the desired sugar level and when part of them - about 50% - has been attacked by noble rot, Botrytis Cinerea. The grape harvesting operation is carried out in conjunction with a very careful selection, which allows you to get only the best. A vinification follows, which involves the use of steel only.  This Auslese by Dr. Loosen has a golden yellow colour, a sign of the density and complexity that characterize it. In fact, the nose shows a very wide aromatic range, which begins with the fruity tones of yellow peach, grapefruit, almond, and then leaves room for a markedly sweet note of honey, enlivened by aromatic herbs and an unmistakable spicy texture. In the mouth, sweetness and flavour coexist in a perfect balance, as well as the full and enveloping body proceeds firmly together with the freshness.

This complexity derives from the vinification of grapes that ripen at different times, being able to provide on the one hand great complexity in the body, on the other hand the compactness of floral and herbaceous aromas. After alcoholic fermentation, the wine rests at a low temperature in contact with the yeasts for a few months. Straw yellow in colour with golden reflections, it has notes of fresh grass, elderberry, tomato leaf of great intensity before opening to a complex and silky taste, with aromas of mint and licorice. Slender and harmonious, it offers a good balance between the varietal part and the fruity component. Ideal wine for white meats and blue cheese based aperitifs, it can accompany raw fish and shellfish."

Champagne Brut Vintage represents the history of Dom Pérignon and its fame is spread all over the world. This wine is dedicated to the Benedictine monk of Hautvillers Abbey who lived in the 17th century and who had contributed to the qualitative growth of Champagne viticulture.
Dom Pérignon was one of the first cuvée de prestige in the history of Champagne. It was the brainchild of Laurence Venn, an English advertising man employed by Simon Bros. & Co., the English importer of Moët & Chandon, who had the idea of creating a very high quality Champagne to be sold to the British aristocracy on an allotment basis.
Made from the best Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes, ripened over the course of a year and harvested towards the end of September. Second fermentation takes place in bottle according to the Champenoise Method. The wine is then aged on the lees for at least 8 years, until the Chef de Cave deems it ready.
In the Champagne region, 2013 was a late year, characterized by a cold and wet winter followed by a very cool and rainy spring. The vines started growing about fifteen days late. The hot and dry summer, with the highest exposure to the sun ever recorded in Champagne, was particularly beneficial to the quality of the grapes. The early September rains soon gave way to the wind, which kept the grapes healthy until harvest. The harvest lasted from 28 September to 15 October, and the grapes showed a promising balance between acidity and roundness.
The nose is delicate and complex. The bouquet reveals notes of eucalyptus, mint and vetiver, accompanied by fruity aromas of mirabelle plum, apricot and orange blossom, finishing with notes of pepper, cardamom and liquorice, iodized and toasted notes. The palate is elegant, clean and precise. At first, it is enveloping and ethereal, only to be reinforced by a fine and silky texture.

Trentodoc Pas Dosé Bonconsey is produced in Trentino from Chardonnay grapes grown at an average altitude of 600 metres above sea level.
Careful selection of the best grapes allows the varietal characteristics to be expressed to the full, with no dosage. Harvested by hand in the second half of August, the grapes are taken to the winery where they are destemmed and left to macerate on the skins for up to 12 hours. Yeasts are added to the must to obtain the base wine, which is re-fermented in the bottle in the spring to refine in contact with the yeasts for at least 30 months before disgorgement and final bottling.
The colour is an intense straw yellow and the perlage is fine and persistent. The nose is dense and compact, with fresh notes of cedar, lime and green apple, accompanied by a very refined touch of yeast. The good tension on the palate is softened by the creamy texture, with pleasant fruity returns and a decidedly persistent finish.

Champagne Brut Vintage represents the history of Dom Pérignon and its fame is spread all over the world. This wine is dedicated to the Benedictine monk of Hautvillers Abbey who lived in the 17th century and who had contributed to the qualitative growth of Champagne viticulture.
Dom Pérignon was one of the first cuvée de prestige in the history of Champagne. It was the brainchild of Laurence Venn, an English advertising man employed by Simon Bros. & Co., the English importer of Moët & Chandon, who had the idea of creating a very high quality Champagne to be sold to the British aristocracy on an allotment basis.
Made from the best Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes, ripened over the course of a year and harvested towards the end of September. Second fermentation takes place in bottle according to the Champenoise Method. The wine is then aged on the lees for at least 8 years, until the Chef de Cave deems it ready.
In the Champagne region, 2013 was a late year, characterized by a cold and wet winter followed by a very cool and rainy spring. The vines started growing about fifteen days late. The hot and dry summer, with the highest exposure to the sun ever recorded in Champagne, was particularly beneficial to the quality of the grapes. The early September rains soon gave way to the wind, which kept the grapes healthy until harvest. The harvest lasted from 28 September to 15 October, and the grapes showed a promising balance between acidity and roundness.
The nose is delicate and complex. The bouquet reveals notes of eucalyptus, mint and vetiver, accompanied by fruity aromas of mirabelle plum, apricot and orange blossom, finishing with notes of pepper, cardamom and liquorice, iodized and toasted notes. The palate is elegant, clean and precise. At first, it is enveloping and ethereal, only to be reinforced by a fine and silky texture.

Château Minuty 281 is a Provençal Rosé which, with the intense blue of the neck of the bottle, pays homage to Pantone 281, the color of the Mediterranean Sea after the mistral, which so influences the Minuty vineyards. This Rosé is also inspired by the visionary and revolutionary ambition of Etienne Matton, father of Jean-Etienne and François, who in the 1970s created an exclusive clone of Grenache, now fundamental for creating the blend of this wine. Born exclusively from grapes owned by the estate, in the heart of the AOC Côtes de Provence, Château Minuty 281 is designed for moments of conviviality, haute couture and haute cuisine. The winemaking of Château Minuty 281 is based on a selection of parcels from the three main vineyard soils, combining Grenache from a single clone with Syrah for a spicy and peppery aftertaste. The grapes are hand harvested to maintain the integrity of the grapes, a rare practice. The expertise, knowledge of the vineyard and delicate touch of Jean-Etienne and François Matton in the winemaking process through to bottling produce this extraordinary Rosé. Château Minuty 281 has a pale pink color and intense and joyful aromas. The initial aroma delicately combines citrus, tropical fruit and white currant, which pave the way for an explosion of complex aromas, with white fruit, vine peach, salty, spicy and white pepper notes. This symphony of aromas blends into a dreamy mouthfeel, enhanced by the wine's body and intense grip. Served chilled (10-12°) rather than cold, Château Minuty 281 pairs beautifully with dishes rich in flavour, fine shellfish such as roasted lobster, lobster in banana leaf or cooked in a scallop risotto. It also goes well with spicy dishes such as Peking duck for its sweet and sour flavor, beef curry for its aromatic spices or grilled yakitori with its sweet sauce.

The Ice Wine Reserve of the Pillitteri winery is produced with Vidal grapes in the Niagara-on-the-Lake wine area located on the eastern border with the state of New York. After the growing season, the low autumn temperatures and frequent snowfalls allow the clusters to develop high levels of acidity and sugars which, with the freezing of the berries on the plant, are retained in the fruit along with a high concentration of aromas and flavours. After harvesting, the frozen clusters are transported quickly to the cellar to proceed with the pressing and separate the ice from the must. We then proceed with fermentation to obtain a sweet wine with a high sugar content and high levels of acidity that make it suitable for ageing. Ageing in oak barrels follows. Beautiful intense golden yellow colour, it has a complex nose of ripe white pulp fruits, dried apricot, almond and refined references of orange blossom and candied fruit, honey and mango. On the palate it maintains the enveloping charge of high sugar levels with a full body, excellent structure and long persistence.

Amarone Costasera Masi hails from the vineyards overlooking picturesque Lake Garda, in the Valpolicella Classica area, one of the reference points for this type of wine, which, together with Barolo and Brunello, symbolizes the aristocracy of Italian red wines. Masi's Costasera is the result of the winery's long experience in drying techniques.
Masi's Amarone Classico Costasera is made from Corvina, Rondinella and Molinara grapes, all harvested and selected by hand. Once harvested, the grapes are placed on bamboo racks, which allow air to circulate between the grapes and limit the formation of mould. The grapes remain on the racks throughout the winter, concentrating sugars and aromas thanks to the slow drying process. Once the grapes have reached an ideal degree of dryness, they are pressed and undergo alcoholic fermentation. Most of the wine thus obtained is aged for 24 months in Slavonian oak barrels, the rest in barriques.
Costasera Masi Amarone has an intense ruby red colour. The nose opens with an intense bouquet of cooked fruit, plums and cherries. On the palate it is fruity, enriched with aromas of coffee and cocoa, which make it a refined, balanced and pleasantly elegant wine that goes well with roast, braised and stewed red meats and game, as well as seasoned cheeses.
Why is Amarone Costasera Masi called this way?
 Amarone Costasera bears this name because the Masi winery believes that the coasts facing the sunset, in Valpolicella Classica, are the best for the production of a great Amarone.
 These are the vineyards that enjoy longer hours of sunshine and benefit from the reflection of the light on Lake Garda. Thanks to these particularly favourable climatic conditions, the grapes here reach perfect ripeness.
Amarone Costasera is also available in the Riserva and Nectar versions, which contain a higher percentage of the Corvina grapes, giving this wine even more softness and roundness."

 Antinori is one of the most illustrious and famous names in the world of Italian wine. The company was born in Tuscany from a long family tradition, which can boast over six hundred years of history. In addition to the winery in the Chianti Classico area, it has estates in Bolgheri, Montalcino, Umbria and Franciacorta. The Guado al Tasso estate is located in the countryside near the historic village of Bolgheri, near the Tyrrhenian coast. It is a real farm of about 1000 hectares, of which 300 are vineyards and the rest cultivated with olive trees, arable land, woods or used for breeding pigs of the fine Cinta Senese variety.  The Bolgheri area has become world famous for the production of famous Supertuscan, wines made with international grapes, in particular cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc and syrah, which have found favorable conditions in this land to express themselves on levels of excellence . The suitable soils, the Mediterranean climate, warm, dry, but always mitigated by the sea breezes and the gentle hillside exposures, have proved to be perfect for quality viticulture. In the wake of the international success of Sassicaia, in the 70s and 80s, the myth of the great Bolgheri reds quickly spread. Wines of extraordinary elegance, richness and aromatic complexity, which soon collected the most prestigious prizes and awards from the main Italian Wine Guides and from the most famous international sector magazines.  Bolgheri DOC Il Bruciato comes from a blend of three great French vines, cabernet sauvignon (65%) which gives structure, elegance and longevity, merlot (20%) which gives softness and harmony and the syrah (15%) which gives the typical spicy notes, which enrich and complete the bouquet.  The grapes, carefully selected in the vineyard, ferment for about 10-15 days partly in barriques and partly in stainless steel tanks, at a temperature of 28-30 ° C. Only a part of merlot and syrah ferments at lower temperatures to better extract and preserve the fragrance of the varietal aromas. After a first period of stabilization, partly in steel and partly in barrique for malolactic fermentation, the wine ages for 8 months in French oak barrique and completes its aging with a further 4 months in the bottle.  The olfactory picture is intense and complex, with aromas of small berries, elegant notes of sweet spices and delicate woody nuances. On the palate it denotes body and structure, with a harmonious sip, characterized by deep aromas, evolved tannins and balanced freshness. The finish is long and persistent.

 Aperol is the most iconic, characteristic and trendy orange aperitif from 1919 to today. The history of Aperol has its roots even in the period of the dominion of the Austrians, who drank wine with a part of water, as is still savoured today in some areas of the Veneto.
As we understand it today, Aperol Spritz was born for the first time in 1919 at the Padua fair, from the intuition of the Barbieri brothers: shortly thereafter, in 1930 Aperol began to become popular, becoming a trendy drink. 
 The drink then, the one based on Prosecco and not wine, would become famous in 1950 thanks to advertising campaigns from America. These are the years in which the first spots in the Carosello are broadcast. Today, Aperol is also an icon of fashion and lifestyle, with an incredible tendency to seduce and please everyone. 
The rest of the story is written every day. 
 Produced according to a secret recipe, the result of 7 years of continuous experimentation, it includes three parts of Prosecco, a slice of bitter orange, gentian, cinchona, rhubarb and other herbs and roots. It opens to the nose with a distinctive citrus trace, supported by herbaceous and vanilla notes. The taste is intense, round and velvety, with a characteristic and pleasant bitter sweet centre.
Aperol Spritz is the perfect drink to accompany the happy hour ritual, ideal to be served straight or with ice: you cannot walk through the aperitif streets without noticing its orange colour that shines in the glasses of the people who sip it, accompanied from an olive to accentuate the flavour of the drink.
